        <h1 class="gradientsecondary">Education System</h1>
        <p>The need of finding the truth is inherent in our nature as a human being. If we only drown ourselves in materialistic animal desire of pleasure (sex, food), we will find that our life can be very discontent. It might seem fine from the outside, but if you dig deeper, you will find the fear to confront yourself. The fear of the question 'why are we here for?' or 'is life only meant to be this way?'. 
        <br>
        <br>If you face the question yourself, you will undergo a journey to find the truth and knowledge. The journey of education.
        <br>
        <br>There are 2 types of 'Education':
        </p>
        <h2 class="gradientsecondary">Part of Society</h2>
        <p><i>(Or, part of machine)</i>
        <br>
        <br>Our society is build like a giant machine, with each person doing their occupation to keep the machine going.
        <br>
        <br>You got people working in banks to keep the money going. People in the entertainment, shooting your favourite tv shows. People making your foods. Or, people making your phones and computers. 
        <br>
        <br>And so, the modern society keeps running.
        <br>
        <br>On the old days, with the lack of technology, it still behaves the same way. Only less varieties. There are people making clothes, blacksmith, preserving literature, becoming a servant, and so on. These people got training, not in the school that is managed by some big central institution, but by becoming apprentices in their respective field. For example, you can become an apprentice blacksmith in your teen years by simply study and work under your local blacksmith. 
        <br>
        <br>Now, in the modern days, government mostly controls the education system. What you learn, what school should teaches you. They teach what they think is necessary. 
        <br>
        <br>This comes at a problem. The government must know what's important. If, of course, they are not tyrannical and decide themselves what's important and what's not - to control power. What's important in this modern society emerges by itself born from complex interaction between technology and the ebb and flow of society's desire. Sometimes, the government isn't fast enough to respond to the nation's important needs because of bureaucracy or some internal agenda that's going on within. 
        <br>
        <br>Sometimes, it is faster for ourselves to decide what's important to study. 
        <br>
        <br>But, what is truly the fundamental for us to study?
        <br>
